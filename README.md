# README Generator
by Jake Smith

## Project Description
In this project, I created an application that can generate a README file using prompts supplied through the terminal. When the user finds a the file through the terminal, running
the command, 'node index.js' will set off a series of prompts that asks for user input to generate a fantastic-looking README file for a project summary. This application leverages
technologies such as NPM Inquirer, FileSystem functions, and a strong understanding of MarkDown language. Ultimately, this is an app designed to make workflows smoother.
